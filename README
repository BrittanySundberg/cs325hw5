Files for HW5 for CS 325

All files are on the engineering flip servers in sundbebr's folders on flip3. This project requires
an input .txt file  that contains the number of wrestlers, n, followed by their names, the number of 
rivalries r and rivalries listed in pairs.
 
To run the files there on the flip3 servers, you need to go to that cs325hw5 folder. Then:

The python file that has the code and algorithm to run is named wrestlers.py

To run wrestlers.py on the engineering flip servers, run the command line "python3 activity.py [fileName].txt" 
and REPLACE "[fileName]" with the name of the text file that has the input data you want to run the algorithm/python file on.
That txt file needs to be in the same folder as the python file, so if you want to run it on your own txt file of data, you
need to add your file to that folder before you run that command.  

The folder on the flip server does contain five test txt documents that were provided with the assignment instructions, named:
test1.txt
test2.txt
wrestler.txt
wrestler1.txt
wrestler2.txt

If you want to run those, the files are in that flip3 folder. If you want to run others, you'll need to add those documents (as mentioned above)

If you are downloading and running the python file somewhere else other than on the flip engineering servers, you will need to make sure you 
have the txt files you want to run on that server, and run the same command line prompt as stated above: "python3 activity.py [fileName].txt" 
and REPLACE "[fileName]" with the name of the text file that has the input data you want to run the algorithm/python file on.

Running the file will print the results to the terminal, as instructed in the PDF instructions.
